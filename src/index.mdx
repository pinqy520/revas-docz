# Introduction

> In the future, Revas would be **a high-performance cross-platform UI framework based on WebAssembly.**
> 
> Now, you can use React and CSS to efficiently write interactive UIs on Canvas.


## Motivation

**Cross Platform** Similar to Flutter, Revas build its own UI system on a cross-platform drawing interface. Flutter uses Skia as the common drawing interface, and Revas uses canvas-like API as its drawing interface. Any host that provides the canvas-like API can run Revas Apps, so in theory Revas can work well on any operating system.

**High Performance** Flutter's high interactive performance benefits from Dart and Skia; and currently, Revas has a fairly smooth interactive experience even through it is still running in a pure JS environment and using Canvas2D for drawing. In my plan , the rendering layer of Revas can be rewritten to WebAssembly, and after using WebGL, rendering will be smoother with GPU acceleration.

**Use anywhere** First of all, the interactive UI built with Revas can be embedded as a widget in a page (Web or client, etc., any container that provides the canvas interface). Second, you can also use Revas to build a complete App.

So in the future Revas could be **a high-performance cross-platform UI framework based on WebAssembly.**
