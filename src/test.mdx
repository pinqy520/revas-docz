# Introduction

> In the future, Revas would be a high-performance cross-platform UI framework based on WebAssembly.
> Now, you can use React and CSS to efficiently write interactive UIs on Canvas.

const base = {
  boxShadow: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0 2px 10px',
  borderRadius: '5px',
  overflow: 'hidden',
  float: 'right',
  marginLeft: '10px',
};

```

## Motivation - and idea

**[Cross Platform]** Similar to Flutter, Revas build its own UI system on a cross-platform drawing interface. Flutter uses Skia as the common drawing interface, and Revas uses canvas-like API as its drawing interface. Any host that provides the canvas-like API can run Revas Apps, so in theory Revas can work well on any operating system.

**[High Performance]** Flutter's high interactive performance benefits from Dart and Skia; and currently, Revas has a fairly smooth interactive experience even through it is still running in a pure JS environment and using Canvas2D for drawing. In my plan , the rendering layer of Revas can be rewritten to WebAssembly, and after using WebGL, rendering will be smoother with GPU acceleration.

**[Use anywhere]** First of all, the interactive UI built with Revas can be embedded as a widget in a page (Web or client, etc., any container that provides the canvas interface). Second, you can also use Revas to build a complete App.

So in the future Revas could be a high-performance cross-platform UI framework based on WebAssembly.
> If Flutter is Dart + Skia, Revas will be Webassembly + WebGL.

## Hello Revas - a quick start

## Scenarios - what revas can do

### 0x1 Widget 

In the browser, just like Flipboard did in its web app (60fps on the mobile web - Flipboard Engineering). The news feed was an infinite parallax scrolling component implemented by react-canvas. When a user adds an article to its Facorites, the snapshot animation is smooth, which cannot be achieved when directly using DOM.

Secondly, in the client, the UI written by Revas can also be dynamically distributed to the client as a component.

### 0x2 Standalone App
